## Introduction and Application of Teachable Machine

 - Teachable Machine is a tool developed by Google that enables the creation of machine learning models in an accessible and intuitive way. With a user-friendly interface, Teachable Machine allows users, even those without programming or data science experience, to train machine learning models using their own data, such as images, sounds, or poses.

 - The central proposition of Teachable Machine is to democratize access to machine learning, empowering individuals to create innovative projects without the need for advanced technical knowledge. Through a simple process of "teaching" the machine to recognize patterns and categories, users can develop applications ranging from interactive games to practical solutions in education, healthcare, and entertainment.

 - In addition to its intuitive interface, Teachable Machine is based on cutting-edge machine learning technology, making it a powerful platform for exploring concepts of artificial intelligence. The application offers the possibility to export trained models for use in websites, applications, and devices, opening a wide range of opportunities for developers and content creators.

 - In this context, Teachable Machine not only serves as an educational tool but also as a means to stimulate creativity and innovation, allowing anyone, regardless of their technical skill level, to participate in the machine learning revolution.
